## 🚧 Implementation Status

The application framework is provided with TODO markers where you need to implement functionality from exercises 1-5:

- **Image processing** (Exercise 01): `image_with_std_mean` function
- **Model loading & embeddings** (Exercise 02): `build_model` and `compute_embeddings` functions  
- **Similarity computation** (Exercise 03): `normalize_l2` and `cosine_similarity` functions
- **Storage system** (Exercise 04): All `LocalFileVectorStorage` methods

**Implementation approach:**
1. Follow the TODO comments and reference your previous exercises
2. Implement incrementally and test each component
3. See how individual pieces work together in a complete application

## 🚀 Application Features

The completed system provides:
- Face embedding generation using ConvNeXt model
- Local file storage for embeddings in JSON format
- Real-time face registration from video stream
- User authentication via face comparison
- YAML-based configuration

## 🔍 Finding and Completing TODOs

### Step 1: Locate TODO Markers
Search for `TODO` comments throughout the codebase. These mark the exact locations where you need to apply your knowledge from exercises 1-5:

```bash
# Find all TODOs in the project
grep -r "TODO" src/
```

### Step 2: TODO Locations by Exercise

**Exercise 01 - Image Processing:**
- `src/image_utils/imagenet.rs`: `image_with_std_mean` function

**Exercise 02 - Embeddings:**
- `src/embeddings/utils.rs`: `build_model` and `compute_embeddings` functions

**Exercise 03 - Similarity:**
- `src/login.rs`: `normalize_l2` and `cosine_similarity` functions

**Exercise 04 - Storage:**
- `src/storage/local_file_vector_storage.rs`: All storage methods (`new`, `load_data`, `save_data`, `store_embedding`, `get_embedding`, `get_all_embeddings`, `delete_embedding`)

**Exercise 05 - Retrieval (Optional Enhancement):**
- `src/login.rs`: Optional similarity search optimization concepts

### Step 3: Implementation Order

**Recommended implementation order:**
1. **Exercise 01**: Image processing (needed for camera input)
2. **Exercise 02**: Model loading and embeddings (core functionality)
3. **Exercise 04**: Storage system (needed to save/load embeddings)
4. **Exercise 03**: Similarity computation (needed for authentication)
5. **Exercise 05**: Optional enhancements (similarity search optimizations)

### Step 4: Test Your Implementation
After completing each exercise's TODOs, test incrementally:

```bash
# Test after each exercise implementation
cargo build

# Run the full application once all TODOs are complete
cargo run
```

### Step 5: Integration Testing
Once all TODOs are implemented:
1. Start the camera server (see Prerequisites section)
2. Run `cargo run` 
3. Test registration: `register` → enter username → look at camera
4. Test login: `login` → enter username → look at camera
5. Verify similarity scores and authentication results

## 🚀 Extra Mile: Advanced Enhancements

### Current Limitation
This implementation focuses on **face embeddings only** - it assumes input images already contain properly cropped and aligned faces. In real-world scenarios, you need **face detection** as a preprocessing step.

### Enhancement Option 1: Complete Face Authentication Pipeline

Integrate face detection to build a complete pipeline:

1. **Add Face Detection**: Use [rustface](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/rustface) - a Rust implementation of SeetaFace detection
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   rustface = "0.1"
   ```

2. **Pipeline Flow**:
   ```
   Raw Image → Face Detection → Face Cropping → Face Embeddings → Authentication
   ```

3. **Benefits**:
   - Handle images with multiple faces or no faces
   - Automatic face cropping and alignment
   - More robust real-world deployment
   - Better user experience (users don't need to manually align faces)

**Implementation Steps**:
- Add rustface dependency
- Implement face detection in image preprocessing
- Add face cropping and alignment
- Handle edge cases (no faces, multiple faces)

### Enhancement Option 2: Production-Grade Vector Storage

Replace JSON storage with [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) vector database:

1. **Add Qdrant Integration**:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   qdrant-client = "1.0"
   ```

2. **Benefits Over JSON Storage**:
   - **Scalability**: Handle millions of face embeddings
   - **Performance**: Optimized vector similarity search
   - **Advanced Features**: Filtering, clustering, hybrid search
   - **Production Ready**: Built for high-throughput applications

3. **Implementation**:
   - Replace `LocalFileVectorStorage` with `QdrantVectorStorage`
   - Implement the same `VectorStorage` trait
   - Add Qdrant configuration to `config.yaml`
   - Use Qdrant's native similarity search instead of manual iteration

**Why This Matters**: JSON storage works for learning but doesn't scale. Production face authentication systems need vector databases to handle thousands of users efficiently.

### Choose Your Challenge
- **Option 1** for computer vision enthusiasts who want to understand the complete pipeline
- **Option 2** for backend developers interested in scalable storage solutions
- **Both** for a production-ready system!
